# Daily Planner

## Purpose
This daily planner's purpose is to show a dynamically created webpage that shows the current date at the top, with timeblocks for a standard business day below. These timeblocks all have the ability to hold an event that the user can edit and save, which will persist through a page refresh. The timeblocks will also be color-coordinated based on what time of the day it is. If the timeblock is in the past, it will show grey. If the timeblock is in the present hour, it will show red. Lastly, if the timeblock is in the future, it will show green.
